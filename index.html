            What You’ll Need
        </h1>
        <p>
            This game is best played with the weirdest, wackiest objects you can carry. 
            Before playing, gather ten strange and silly objects varying in shape, color, material, 
            and use and place them within arm reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a game that is played exclusively on zoom.
            Each participant must have an internet connection, some sort of device that can 
            run the latest update of Zoom, a webcam, and a microphone. This is a game for four to twenty five players, 
            but is best played by groups that can be equally divided into a grid on Zoom’s screen. Before the game starts, 
            have every member rearrange and coordinate the screens on Zoom so that everyone has the same configuration. 
            Get the web application up and running (that's this page!.

        </p>

        <h1>
            The Web Application
        </h1>
        <p>
            This application generates a random countdown between two set variables. For this game, put 60 as
            the maximum time and 30 as the minimum. To begin a round, press play.
        </p>

        <h1>
            The Game
        </h1>
        <p>
            Much like the game of hot potato, the goal of this game is to not be the last person holding the 
            object when the timer goes off. In lieu of potatoes, participants will be tasked with passing weird and wacky
            objects from screen to screen. Participants may pass up, left, right, diagonal, and from one edge of the screen 
            to the opposite to other players. The objects passed must be the same in either shape, (i.g. Slinky to cup because 
            they’re both round) color (i.g. blue pants to blue cheese) material (i.g. plastic handcuffs to plastic grapes) or use 
            (i.g. pen to pencil because they can both be used to write). 
        </p>

        <h1>
            Elimination
        </h1>
        <p>
            When the timer goes off and the potato explodes, the person holding the object is eliminated. If the player says the name of 
            the object but does not pass the object fully off screen when the timer goes off, that participant is eliminated. Elimination results in 
            the player either turning off his or her camera or changing the filter on Zoom to black and white. Once a participant is eliminated, he or
             she still has the chance to intercept a passed object and swap positions with a player in the game. This can be done by holding up the same 
             object as someone who is passing and presenting it before the next person can present a new object. When this happens, the eliminated 
             participant turns on his or her camera or changes the Zoom filter back to full color while the usurped player turns his or her camera off. 
             If at any point in the game the players who are active are unable to pass to two other active players, reorganise the game board accordingly.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Endgame
        </h1>
        <p>
            This game is played until there is only one person left. That participant is the winner and the President of Zoomtatopia.
